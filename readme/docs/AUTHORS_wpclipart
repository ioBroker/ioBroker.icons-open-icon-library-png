
WPClipart is a collection of high-quality, Public Domain 
images tailored for use in word processors and output on 
inkjet printers. The entire collection is included in the 
WPClipart download (although the website is more frequently 
updated, and has a search function atop every page.)

The WPClipart website is:
http://www.wpclipart.com


WPClipart-7.0
Contains 22,313 non-transparent PNG images.

The full package contains all the clipart along with the 
viewer/editor application. (This application is useful, but 
is NOT necessary in order to use the clipart, as the images 
are all in standard PNG format.)

There are also packs of clip art categories, downloadable 
with the viewer and packed in a Windows installer. 

The viewer/editor also has a stand-alone installer.

And finally, individual zip archives of each and every 
category are also available for download.



Terms of Use 

These images are public domain, and that means they can be 
used and edited for whatever purpose you wish, personal or 
commercial. No attribution or linking is required.  the 
sources for all the images are listed on the WPClipart legal 
page http://www.wpclipart/legal.html. There is only one 
modest exceptions to being able to do anything at all with 
any of the images . . . 


--- Minor Exception --------

  My website is mine. I do not expect anyone to copy my 
site or the image collection (in large part) to host online 
or sell. This would compete with my site, draining what 
revenue I generate through online ads. These pay for hosting 
and modestly compensate me all the ink I use in test printing 
and for the hundreds of hours I spend finding, creating and 
editing images. 

  That said, if you wish to include the collection within 
a GPL-ed Linux distribution or create a package for that 
distribution, you are more than welcome to do so. I am a 
big proponent of Open Source and originally created a modest 
version of the collection for my kids to use on Linux with 
AbiWord. To be able to devote time to the project I need 
the site to generate some revenue -- but first and foremost, 
the clipart was made as a resource for school kids and others 
to use without fear of copyright infringement and the risk of 
running into all sorts of "untoward" pictures when searching 
the web for graphics. I'd like to keep it that way.

  If any school wishes to place the collection on a common 
server for use within the school or district -- it would be 
my honour for you to use the project in such a way.


[VIEWER/EDITOR]

WP Clipper (c)2005-2008 by Paul Sherman
Distributed under the GNU GPL version 3

WP Clipper is a cross-platform, hybrid image viewer and 
image editing program. It was designed specifically with 
WPClipart in mind, but it can be used to view/edit almost 
any clipart or photograph. 

It can accomplish several simple transforms (tilt/rotate) 
and has several filters as well as color/brightness tweaking 
abilities.It can then re-save the image in PNG or JPG format 
or copy to the clipboard for immediate pasting into another 
program. It can paste into OpenOffice, AbiWord, Windows Word 
and WordPad. (So you can view images easily and paste them, 
with some quick change, directly into your word-processing 
application.



[INSTALLATION]


FOR WINDOWS:
------------
I distribute binaries for Windows, tested on 2000 and XP.
(So you don't even need Python to run it on Windows.)

Run the program "wpclipper",
...or browse the WPClipart directoty tree.



FOR LINUX:
----------
Use the source for Linux.

For ease of use with the clipart collection, place the 
wpclipper.py script in the wpclipart-x.x/viewer folder.
In that way the viewer will open with the first directory 
listedcontaining the clipart. Make sure the wpclipper.py 
is set as executable.


Look for WPClipper or WPClipart on my website:
http://www.wpclipart.com

If you use the source version you will need to have
python >= 2.5
pyGTK >= 2.10
PIL >= 1.1.6 (Python Imaging Library)



[Program background...]

It was initially developed on Linux for my kids to use in 
conjunction with AbiWord (which they used on Windows machines 
in their middle school.) There were two reasons I made the 
collection and program:

1] I was uncomfortable with the kids doing image searches 
    online. (See the site information below...)

2] Linux did not have a little viewer/editor program that 
    could copy and paste into AbiWord. Also, for ease of 
	use I wanted the speed and simplicity of a viewer, 
	but with some quick and easy editing for basic things 
	like rotation, some color/contrast adjustments and 
	for fun a few filters.
    
The program was first written using the wxWindows GUI 
toolkit, as it was then needed for proper clipboard 
functionality... but updates to pyGTK have made the use 
of that toolkit possible, and has made the overall 
software requirements for the program leaner, able to 
be used on computers with slightly older hardware and 
in most cases able to run without installing additional 
dependencies -- as python-gtk is a much more commonly 
installed development library. It is also available on 
the OLPC machines.

Making the program/collection available to OLPC machines, 
as well as many commodity PCs in use for education, 
fits precisely with the goals of WPClipart.


[Clipart Site background...]

The project started as a "safe" collection of clipart 
for my kids. Their middle school used AbiWord, and they 
were often searching for clipart that was both safe and 
copyright-free. Since this proved to be both difficult 
and hazardous (since image searches often yielded some 
very untoward photos) I decided to create a  simple 
collection for their use. My background as both a photographer 
and a programmer lent itself well to the project, I put it 
online with my software for others to download and as the 
months passed it became very popular.

I made thumbnail pages and put up some Google ads, 
(made a bit of change every day), then suddenly the 
Google image search engine spidered the site and my 
server was a bit overwhelmed. After fielding 20-30k hits 
a day for a year or so I ended up putting the collection on 
a dedicated remote server, and the ad revenue takes care 
of the expense. And by using good image tagging and 
submitting XML sitemaps to Google with each update, the 
custom search function really helps track images down.
