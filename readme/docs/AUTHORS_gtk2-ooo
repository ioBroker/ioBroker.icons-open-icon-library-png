================================================================================


 To install the static theme:
 ----------------------------
 copy "genBitmaps" directory and "imagelist.xml" to OOo config directory
 (OpenOffice.org1.1.0/user/config/soffice.cfg/)
 Note: If soffice.cfg does not exist, you will have to create it yourself.

 You may notice that the icon backgound color may not match the rest of
 the toolbar.  Default toolbar color is light, something that goes well with
 standard kde themes.  There is also a userimages.gray.bmp under genBitmaps.
 You can rename it to userimages.bmp and install that instead (if it goes
 better with your OOo background).

 You can also change the background color to a specific color, explained as
 follows.

 To change the icon background color:
 ------------------------------------
 1. set background_color <your_color> in bkColor.tcl

 2. run: tclsh bkColor.tcl

 3. copy "genBitmaps" directory and "imagelist.xml" to your OOo
    config directory

 (see README.bkColor)


 To generate new icon themes:
 ----------------------------
 see README.gentheme
 distribute "genBitmaps" and "imagelist.xml" along with bkColor.tcl
 

 ISSUES:
 -------
 1. If background color is lighter than #f1f1f1, toolbar highlighting
    will get messed up.

 2. Debian users installing the custom OOo cannot set icon-masking false
